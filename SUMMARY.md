**Black Pod Rot and Pod Borer on Cocoa Pod** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 2436 images with 9377 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *cocoa*, *cocoa_bbox*, *black_pod_rot*, and other: *black_pod_rot_bbox*, *pod_borer*, and *pod_borer_bbox*.

Images in the Black Pod Rot dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (1930 images) and *val* (506 images). The dataset was released in 2021.
